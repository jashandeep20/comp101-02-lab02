You have created a GitHub repository and want to share it with your friend Bob by
sending him the repository link. When Bob clicks the link in his web browser, some
communication happens over the internet. Explain step by step what happens using the
concepts of client and server. In your explanation, make sure to mention:
• Which device acts as the client
• Which device acts as the server
• How Bob’s browser requests the repository content
• How the server responds and sends the content back to Bob
Answers:-
Bob clicks the link in his browser – his device acts as the client.

The browser sends a request to GitHub’s server for the repository page.

The server receives the request and finds the needed content.

The server sends a response back with the page data (HTML, CSS, etc.).

The client (Bob’s browser) displays the repository page.
